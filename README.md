# SOCCER LEAGUE BUILDER
This program is part of the **Treehouse Python Techdegree**. The logic constructed divides a list of 18 children who have signed up for a soccer league into three even teams: **Dragons**, **Sharks** and **Raptors**. For each child, the following information is provided: Name, height (in inches), whether or not they have played soccer before, and their guardians’ names. 
## Project details
Overall program: 
* Reads the data from the CSV file **soccer_players.csv** and stores that data in an appropriate data type so that it can be used in the following tasks.
* The script iterates through all 18 players and assigns them to teams such that each team has the same number of players. But also the number of experienced players on each team is the same.
* The program output a text file named **teams.txt** that contains the league roster listing the **team name**, and each player on the team including the player's information: **name**, **whether they've played soccer before** and **their guardians' names**.
* In addition, 18 text files are created (outputs in **guardians_letters**). These welcome letters to the players' guardians use each player’s name as the name of file.
